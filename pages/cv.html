                        The class starts with a short introduction on the biology of the microorganisms to be sequenced, introductions to high-throughput sequence technology and assembly.
                        After that a number of sessions in bioinformatics follow, first to learn to communicate in Unix, then to run assemblies on the sequence data sets produced by LGF.
                        We will teach and practice annotation and subsystems analysis. In the second semester, the class is followed with another practical part, annotation of the major important functions in the genome and presentation of results.
