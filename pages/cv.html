                        The class starts with a short introduction on the biology of the microorganisms to be sequenced, introductions to high-throughput sequence technology and assembly.
                        After that a number of sessions in bioinformatics follow, first to learn to communicate in Unix, then to run assemblies on the sequence data sets produced by LGF.
                        We will teach and practice annotation and subsystems analysis. In the second semester, the class is followed with another practical part, annotation of the major important functions in the genome and presentation of results.

                        Different themes in cell biology are covered each week, such as intracellular signal
                        transduction, gene regulation and non-coding RNA, specialised cells and basic tissue
                        types, cell cycle and cancer, cell interactions, the extracellular matrix and the

                        control cells and the basic functions of their surroundings. The course acts as a bridge
                        to future courses in e.g. neurobiology and immunology as well as human organ
                        systems and homeostasis by discussing specialised cells and their role in different

                        legal and political factors explain the structure of firms – but also the other way

                        understanding of financial accounting.<br>
                        The first part of the course presents accounting as a form of communication and a
                        powerful tool for decision making for the management of companies as well as
                        external users. It introduces each of the financial statements, its purpose and
                        relationship among them. Further, it covers the conceptual framework of accounting
                        and important differences between the International Financial Reporting Standards
                        and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.<br>
                        The second part of the course covers the processing of accounting transactions using
                        the double entry accounting system. It covers accounting for income, expenses,
                        assets, liabilities and equity. This part of the course provides students the knowledge
                        and tools to prepare a simple set of financial accounts. Students will be exposed to
                        how a transaction affects the accounting equation; the income statement, balance
                        sheet and financial statements as a whole.<br>
                        The third part of the course provides students with a framework to perform financial
                        analysis of companies. This is carried out through computing and using various ratios
                        to assess the liquidity, solvency and profitability of a company to determine the
                        company's performance. The course also covers ethical issues and dilemmas relating
                        to accounting and the moral and social implications of accounting decisions.

                    <span class="course-description">
                        <b>Financial Economics:</b> The course starts with a description of the different roles of the financial system,
                        followed by a survey of the most important financial markets and instruments
                        including simple derivatives. Throughout the course special attention is given to the
                        pricing of risk and risk management. The portfolio choice of a risk avert individual is
                        thoroughly examined. The efficient market hypothesis and its role in making
                        investment decisions is also discussed. Finally, corporate financing and dividend policy
                        are discussed.

                        <b>Organisation and Leadership:</b> This course introduces the student to central traditions in organization and leadership 
                        studies. The aim is to equip students with a basic set of concepts and perspectives 
                        needed to analyse and understand organizational phenomena and make sense of 
                        challenges managers and workers might face. The following theoretical themes 
                        (among others) are included: Motivation, culture, control, leadership and 
                        organizational design.<br>
                        Furthermore, the course seeks to develop analytical (problem-identifying) and decision 
                        making (problem-solving) skills required to manage complex situations, as well as train 
                        students in argumentation and presentation skills. An important pedagogical idea of 
                        the course is to make sure that theories are applied to organizational practice. Case 
                        studies will be the main tool to accomplish this. In order to address the complexity of 
                        organizational issues, various perspectives will be adopted when organizational 
                        practice is discussed, and emphasis will be put on reflective usage of theories.

                        <b>Managing Digitalisation:</b> The course focuses on the challenges that digitalisation poses in the modern 
                        organisation. To manage digitalisation, both managerial and technological aspects 
                        must be considered in conjunction. By studying theories on digitalisation and 
                        analysing cases, the course focuses on how information technology alters internal and 
                        external processes within and across organisations and society.

                    Initial Programming in Java
                    <span class="course-description">
                        <b>Initial Programming in Java:</b> Programming is very much about solving problems. The course is therefore built around problem-solving, i.e., a 
                        solution to a problem is worked out through structured logic and then transferred to a functioning Java program. Hence considerable part of the course
                        is focused on hands-on exercises that solve simple and common problems. This beginners' Java course focuses on structural programming and aims to provide
                        students with a solid understanding of Java programming concepts. Students will learn about variables, control structures, basic syntax, and principles 
                        like modularization and sequencing. They will gain skills in writing, compiling, and executing Java programs. The course emphasizes problem-solving by 
                        breaking down complex tasks and applying structural programming techniques. Students will also develop debugging skills and adhere to coding conventions.
