    <p style="font-size: 26px;">2024 I competed in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM. Every year, over 400 teams from all over the world gather to take part in the competition
        where the goal is to come up with a solution to a local problem using synthetic biology. My team decided to create a novel pesticide that targets an essential
        developmental gene in the Asian hornet, an invasive species of hornet
        that hunts local insects and damage fruit crops. To ensure specificity of the pesticide, we created a box in which we aimed to place the bait. The box was 
        outfitted with motion detector sensors and cameras that with an image recognition software only were to open the doors to the bait if an Asian hornet was observed.</p>
    <img src="/static/images/iGEMbox.gif" alt="Animation of our project idea" style="width: 50%;">
    <p style="font-size: 26px;">My role in this project was primarily focused on adapting the image recognition software to fit with our needs. I was also involved in building the box in which
        we were to place the bait and in coding our website (wiki) for our results.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 26px;">Here is our (almost) finished box design!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 26px;">Our team received a gold medal and we finished top 3 in the conservation category. We were also nominated for best presentation and best wiki.</p>
