      <h2>iGEM</h2>
      <p>During 2024, I competed in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM. Every year, over 400 teams from all over the world gather to take part in the competition
        where the goal is to come up with a solution to a local problem using synthetic biology.</p>
      <p>My team decided to create a novel pesticide that targets an essential
        developmental gene in the Asian hornet, an invasive species of hornet
        that hunts local insects and damage fruit crops. To ensure specificity of the pesticide, we created a box in which we aimed to place the bait. The box was 
        outfitted with motion detector sensors and cameras that with an image recognition software only were to open the doors to the bait if an Asian hornet was observed...</p>

      <h2>First Step Project</h2>
      <p>As part of my Master's programme, I did a First Step project in the Fasshauer lab under the supervision of Aysima Hacisuleyman. My project revolved around identifying the
        specified pathway in which SNARE protein complexes tend to disassemble. I utilised molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics to simulate the disassembly processes,
        and built an autoencoder that analyses stiffness matrices, looking for anomalies and building stiffness propagation pathways.

      <h2>BSc Thesis Project</h2>
      <p>In my final year of my BSc Programme in biomedicine, I did my BSc thesis in the lab group of Kristian Pietras under the supervision of Jonas Sj√∂lund 
        where I used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to investigate possible novel cell types in glioblastoma (GBM). In addition to the scRNA-seq 
        analysis work, I performd RNAscope experiments. I ended up finding fibroblast-like cells in both the glioblastoma dataset used in the bioinformatic analysis 
        and the mouse model used during wet-lab experiments. A subtype of these cells with a myofibroblastic phenotype was also shown to correlate 
        with a worse prognosis for patients with the disease.
      </p>
      <p>During this project, I learned how to plan my own experiments, balancing both wet-lab and dry-lab work. Additionally, seeing as at this time, I had yet to have an official programming course,
        I spent a lot of my time looking for answers to the bioinformatic problems I encountered. I learned both how to search for answers online and how to ask
        the correct questions to receive the answers I needed to move my work forward.

      <h2>Summer Research Scholarship</h2>
      <p>Between my first and second year of my BSc programme, I applied for, and was rewarded the The Summer Research Scholarship from Lund University. I got the opportunity
        to undertake a research project in Daniella Rylander Ottosson's lab group focusing on investigating the possibility to reprogram glial cells into interneurons in the 
        brains of mice.
      </p>
      <p>Working under supervision of Srisaiyini Kidnapillai, I got to learn a lot of basic wet-lab protocols and about <i>in vivo</i> experiments.</p>

      <h2>Summer Research School with Biomedical Orientation</h2>
      <p>The summer of 2019, I gained my first insights into biomedical research when I participated in the Summer Research School with Biomedical Orientation organised at the Karolinska
        Institute in Stockholm. I did my project in Dasiel O. Borroto-Escuela's lab investigating the effects of serotonin and dopamine on a specific receptor complex in rat models of schizophrenia.
      </p>
      <p>During the research school, I gained a lot of insights into how research is conducted and how to look for information in scientific literature.</p>
