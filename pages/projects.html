      <h2>iGEM</h2>
      <p>During 2024, I competed in the international synthetic biology competition iGEM. Every year, over 400 teams from all over the world gather to take part in the competition
        where the goal is to come up with a solution to a local problem using synthetic biology.</p>
      <p>My team decided to create a novel pesticide that targets an essential
        developmental gene in the Asian hornet, an invasive species of hornet
        that hunts local insects and damage fruit crops. To ensure specificity of the pesticide, we created a box in which we aimed to place the bait. The box was 
        outfitted with motion detector sensors and cameras that with an image recognition software only were to open the doors to the bait if an Asian hornet was observed...</p>

      <h2>BSc Thesis Project</h2>
      <p>In my final year of my BSc Programme in biomedicine, I did my BSc thesis in the lab group of Kristian Pietras where I used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate 
        possible novel cell types in glioblastome (GBM).

      <h2>Summer Research School with Biomedical Orientation</h2>
      <p>The summer of 2019, I gained my first insights into biomedical research when I participated in the Summer Research School with Biomedical Orientation organised at the Karolinska
        Institute in Stockholm. I did my project in Dasiel O. Borroto-Escuela's lab investigating the effects of serotonin and dopamine on a specific receptor complex in rat models of schizophrenia.
